  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anatomical changes that take place during Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      treatments for cancers of the head and neck cause significant dosimetric changes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's hypothesis is that those patients with bulky head and neck cancers who
      undergo definitive radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy have changes in their dose
      distribution that lead to significant changes in dose to tumor and/or normal tissue.  It is
      possible for these dosimetric changes could occur in either those patients who undergo
      resection or not. In this study those patients who have undergone a resection will be
      stratified separately for analysis, however, this study is not powered to detect a
      difference between the two groups.  The rational for stratification into an operated group
      of patients is that these patients will also lose weight in treatment and will provide us a
      detection of the magnitude of change in dose caused by weight loss independent of tumor
      shrinkage.

        Patients with pathologic stage I-IV cancers of the head and neck (site of tumor origin
        nasopharynx, parotid, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx,)  either following
        gross total resection and requiring postoperative XRT for high-risk features or undergoing
        definitive concurrent chemo-radiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AJCC pathological stage I-IV cancers of the head and neck meeting the following
             criteria:

               -  If gross total resection is performed it must be completed within 7 weeks of
                  registration

          -  Site of tumor origin in the nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, parotid, larynx, or
             hypopharynx (excluding lip, or sinuses)

               -  History and physical examination within four weeks prior to study entry

               -  Dental evaluation with management according to the guidelines in Appendix IV
                  prior to start of radiation

               -  Serum pregnancy test, if applicable, within one week prior to study entry; urine

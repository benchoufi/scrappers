    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies an informed decision making intervention of screening for
      prostate cancer in predominantly African American participants. It also evaluates
      participants' knowledge about prostate cancer screening and to improve understanding. Using
      decision aids such as culturally sensitive written material, verbal information, and videos
      to educate patients about screening may increase patient participation and knowledge. This
      may increase confidence in participants' decisions. Raising awareness about prostate cancer
      in the communities may increase the participants' willingness to be screened for prostate
      cancer once they have learned about it.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve knowledge about prostate cancer screening and to assess the usefulness of a
      proposed educational model in making an informed decision in a high risk population.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete an educational intervention comprising a 10-20 minute PowerPoint
      presentation given by an experienced healthcare professional that discusses prostate cancer
      facts, screening guidelines, risks, benefits, and consequences. Some participants then
      undergo a screening exam comprising a prostate specific antigen level and digital rectal
      exam.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up periodically.

    <description>Improved understanding will be defined as an increase in the number of correct answers seen on the post Prostate Screening Education Questionnaire. The underlying likelihood of a positive response, or improved understanding of prostate cancer screening, can be estimated using a 95% confidence interval that has a maximum half-width of 6%.</description>

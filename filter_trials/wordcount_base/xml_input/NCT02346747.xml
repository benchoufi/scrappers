  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study of
      maintenance FANG in women with Stages III/IV high-grade serous / endometrioid ovarian,
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have achieved a clinically defined complete
      response following primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.  Acceptable chemotherapy
      includes 5-6 cycles of standard platinum / taxane delivered after surgery, or 5-6 cycles
      intraperitoneal + intravenous (IP/IVP) chemotherapy, or 5-6 cycles of standard platinum /
      taxane divided into neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy flanking primary debulking surgery.
      Clinical complete response is defined as normal CT scan or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis, normal
      chest X-ray, normal physical examination, CA-125 antigen level ≤ 35 units/ml (assessed ≥ 2
      weeks following removal of catheter in patients receiving intraperitoneal/intravenous
      chemotherapy) and no symptoms suggestive of the presence of active disease.  These patients
      will have had FANG and placebo prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at the
      time of primary surgical debulking or initial diagnostic/evaluative laparoscopy (required
      prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy).  Patients meeting eligibility criteria
      (including availability of a minimum of 4 FANG aliquots) will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      either monthly intradermal FANG or placebo for ≥4 to a maximum of 12 administrations.  Key
      trial endpoints include recurrence free survival and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of maintenance
      FANG in women with Stages III/IV high-grade serous / endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer.  Tumor will be harvested for FANG manufacture at the time of
      primary surgical debulking or initial diagnostic/evaluative laparoscopy (tumor harvest must
      occur prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy).  Subsequently, patients who achieve
      complete clinical response (cCR) following surgical debulking and standard of care
      chemotherapy and meeting eligibility criteria (including a minimum of 4 FANG immunotherapy
      aliquots) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Group A, FANG, (approximately 220 patients)
      or Group B, placebo, (approximately 220 patients).  Group A will receive 1.0 x 10e7 cells of
      gene transfected, irradiated, autologous tumor cells and Group B will receive &quot;freeze&quot; media
      via intradermal injection once a month for ≥4 to a maximum of 12 doses.  The number of doses
      of immunotherapy vs placebo that a subject receives will be equal to the number of doses of
      FANG manufactured for that subject. The randomization will be stratified by 1) surgical
      stage (CR/microscopic versus macroscopic residual disease) and 2) primary surgery versus
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  A minimum tumor harvest aliquot of approximately 30 grams of
      tissue needed to produce 4 monthly injections will be required for entry into the study.
      The patients will be managed in an outpatient setting.

    <textblock>
      Research Hypothesis:  Ipilimumab (an antibody that blocks negative signals to T cells)
      administered alone or in combination with a pancreatic cancer vaccine (allogeneic pancreatic
      tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene), has an acceptable safety profile in subjects
      with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Primary Objective:  To determine the safety profile of ipilimumab alone or in combination
      with a pancreatic cancer vaccine in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate overall survival (OS) which will serve as the primary efficacy signal.

        -  To explore an association of T cell responses and immunological responses with OS in
           patients receiving treatment.

        -  To estimate overall response rate (ORR), immune related best overall response rate
           (irBOR), progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response in patients
           receiving treatment.

        -  To explore an association between immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) and ORR.

        -  To measure tumor marker kinetics (CA 19-9) in patients receiving treatment.

    <description>Unnacceptable toxicities are defined as drug related &gt; grade 4 AEs or grade 3 AE including IRAEs not improving to &lt; grade 2 under therapy within 2 weeks.  In addition, &gt; grade 2 eye pain or reduction of visual acuity that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to &lt; grade 1 severity within 2 weeks of starting therapy, or requires systemic therapy is an unacceptable toxicity.</description>

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a gastric cancer registry. A registry is a
      database of information. With the registry, we can learn more about the genetic causes of
      gastric cancer in order to develop better methods of early diagnosis, prevention, and
      treatment of gastric cancers. As part of this study, you will be asked to join a registry of
      families who are affected with various forms of gastric cancer. These registries are
      important because they may help physicians better manage gastric cancer now and in the
      future. Participating in the Early Onset and Familial Gastric Cancer Registry can also be
      educational for families, since it will provide important information to patients, families,
      and physicians. All of this will help to further our understanding of genetic causes of
      gastric cancer and eventually, help determine better ways to diagnose, treat, and survey
      patients with gastric cancer and people who may have a higher risk for gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On a global basis, cancer of the stomach is the third most prevalent malignancy, with
      947,000 expected new cases in 2000, and the second leading cancer cause of death (734,000
      deaths annually). In the United States in 2003, approximately 22,400 cases of gastric cancer
      will be diagnosed, and 12,100 patients will die from this disease1. The prognosis of this
      disease is poor with 5-year relative survival rate of less than 20% for advanced disease.
      The etiology of gastric cancer is attributable to both environmental and hereditary factors.
      In the subset of patients with early onset disease and in particular among familial forms of
      this disease, inherited susceptibility appears to play a dominant role. No single mutation
      has been identified as responsible for early onset gastric cancer. Recent evidence has
      emerged supporting the role of germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) as
      conferring increased susceptibility to early onset diffuse type gastric cancer and better
      understanding of other genes that predispose to gastric cancer tumorigenesis is anticipated
      in the next several years2, 3. The primary purpose of this protocol is to establish a
      prospective registry with detailed family history, gastric cancer risk factors, germline
      DNA, and matched tumor and normal tissue for patients with early onset or familial gastric
      cancer and their at-risk relatives. With this aim in mind, we have amended the registry to
      include populations who are at low risk for germline etiology for the development of gastric
      cancer. This includes a cohort of patients with gastric cancer who appear to have developed
      the disease sporadically, as well as a cohort of  control patients without gastric cancer.
      Secondary objectives are 1) To measure the incidence of germline mutations in CDH1 among
      &quot;early onset&quot; and &quot;familial&quot; gastric cancer patients and their relatives to determine the
      importance of this variant in gastric cancer susceptibility and 2) To measure the prevalence
      of abnormal gastric pathology among the cancer-free relatives of patients with &quot;early onset&quot;
      and &quot;familial&quot; gastric cancer. In this research protocol, early onset gastric cancer (EOGC)
      is defined as disease with age of onset before 50 that arises in the absence of family
      history of gastric cancer or known hereditary cancer syndrome. Familial gastric cancer (FGC)
      is defined as disease that occurs among individuals with at least one affected first degree
      relative or two or more affected second degree relatives.Patients eligible for the
      &quot;sporadic&quot; cohort are those not eligible for the EOGC or FGC. We will also establish a &quot;low
      risk&quot; cohort for comparison. Patients eligible for the &quot;low risk&quot; cohort are those not
      eligible for the EOGC or FGC. Study participants will fill out a questionnaire on their
      family history and on their gastric cancer risk factors. Participants will be invited to
      provide a sample of germline DNA for future genetic studies. Select high risk individuals,
      for example those that meet criteria for Diffuse Hereditary Gastric Cancer(DHGC),   will be
      invited to participate in genetic counseling which is required prior to evaluation for CDH1
      gene mutations. Select MSKCC participants who have Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer
      syndrome with identified CDH1 germline genetic mutation may be invited by MSKCC only to
      complete a Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) survey. In addition, participants will
      be invited to provide tissue (tumor and normal) where available, both fresh frozen and
      paraffin-embedded if possible. At risk relatives of patients with EOGC/FGC will also be
      invited for a single upper endoscopy screening test. At select sites, at risk relatives of
      patients with EOGC/FGC will also be invited for a single upper endoscopy screening test. The
      Early Onset/Familial Gastric Cancer Registry will serve as a source of clinical and
      pathological material that can be used to identify future genetic abnormalities that may or
      may not predispose the development of gastric cancer in these high-risk families and will
      help define a cohort for participation in future chemoprevention/screening studies.
      Moreover, it will ensure that there is a coherent unified approach for management of this
      rare group of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient/Relative Cohort:

        Must meet one or more criteria below:

          1. A person with a diagnosis of gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
             adenocarcinoma.

          2. A person without gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who has or had a first degree relative
             eligible for a High Risk Genetic sub-group (EOGC/FGC).

               1. Early Onset Gastric Cancer - diagnosis of gastric cancer before the age of 50
                  without a family history of the disease.

               2. Familial Gastric Cancer - having a family history of gastric cancer as defined
                  as one first degree relative or 2 second degree relatives.

        Patients are ineligible for the study if they:

          -  Have any condition, which in the opinion of the primary MSKCC clinician or

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to develop new tools to guide patients, caregivers,
      and clinicians in making individualized decisions regarding colorectal cancer (CRC)
      surveillance. As part of a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded contract,
      principal investigator will analyze surveillance data to determine the effectiveness of CRC
      surveillance and recurrence risk taking into account different patient and tumor
      characteristics; identify key issues about CRC surveillance important to patients,
      caregivers, and clinicians; and integrate the recurrence risk and patient priorities into a
      patient-centered, risk stratified surveillance strategy by creating an interactive decision
      aid for use by patients and clinicians.

      The specific aims of the study are:

      Aim 1 - Determine the effectiveness of surveillance of colorectal cancer patients following
      curative resection and the factors associated with recurrence treatment eligibility.

      Aim 2 - Identify key priorities for surveillance that are important to patients and
      clinicians through stakeholder engagement.

      Aim 3 - Develop a patient-centered risk-stratified surveillance strategy utilizing a novel,
      interactive, decision aid to facilitate shared decision making.

      This protocol addresses a formative step in the creation of the interactive decision aid
      where patients' information needs and preferences are assessed regarding decisions about
      surveillance.

      The specific aims of this protocol are:

      Phase 1 - To interview patients and their caregivers to determine their concerns,
      preferences and key priorities regarding surveillance after curative resection of colorectal
      cancer, and

      Phase 2 - To refine the key priorities identified in phase 1 through focus groups and
      surveys with patients and caregivers.

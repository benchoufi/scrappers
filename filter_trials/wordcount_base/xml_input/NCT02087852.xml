      This registry will help us develop better methods of:

        -  Preventing these cancers

        -  Diagnosing these cancers

        -  Treating these cancers

        Urologists, clinical geneticists, and medical oncologists at MSKCC, along with study
        personnel will identify patients, family members, and unaffected controls that may be
        eligible for the registry. Patients and families may also be directly referred to the
        MSKCC study team by any MSKCC physician, external physician, or by the family itself.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Kidney Cancer Case Cohort:

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

          -  Must have a diagnosis or suspicion of kidney cancer

        Family Member Cohort:

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

          -  Must be a blood relative of the proband. Family members of probands including mother,
             father, sisters, brothers, half-sisters, half-brothers, daughters, sons,
             grandmothers, grandfathers, as well as aunts and uncles are eligible. These
             individuals need not have kidney cancer, as they will be used for segregation
             analysis of suspected variants found in the proband; requesting DNA from relatives is
             required.

        Control Cohort:

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

          -  Must not have a personal history of cancer, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin
             cancer, AND

          -  Must not be a blood relative of any cases or controls enrolled in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the primary MSKCC clinician or the investigator, have
             a condition that precludes their ability to provide an informed consent

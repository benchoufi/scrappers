  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experiments outlined in this proposal will compare a number of currently available
      techniques for assessing hypoxia and interstitial fluid pressures in patients with cervix
      cancer. The aim of these experiments is to establish the relationship of the clinically
      relevant outcome measures of tumour control and survival following radiation therapy with
      these biological characteristics of carcinoma of the cervix relevant to tumour hypoxia.
      These characteristics will be assessed in patients undergoing treatment using techniques
      which have reached an appropriate level of development for clinical evaluation and aim to
      determine the best technique for determining these parameters of the tumour
      microenvironment. A number of novel strategies directed at the microenvironment are
      undergoing or soon will be undergoing clinical evaluation and selection of appropriate
      patients for these trials is of great importance.

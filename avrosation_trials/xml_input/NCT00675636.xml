      RATIONALE: Gathering medical and family history information from patients and family members
      may help doctors better understand hereditary colorectal cancer and hereditary polyposis
      syndrome and identify patients at high risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is collecting information from patients and family members with
      hereditary colorectal cancer or polyposis syndrome or who are at high risk of developing
      hereditary colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify patients and their family members who have either hereditary colorectal
           cancer or polyposis syndrome or are at high risk for developing hereditary colorectal
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To establish a tissue and data repository that will be used to further research in
           hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes.

      OUTLINE: Data is collected on patients and their families for inclusion in a hereditary
      colorectal cancer registry. Registry data is entered into a secure database that includes
      information on patient demographics and medical and family cancer history. The information
      collected will be used to formulate screening and surveillance recommendations, to further
      knowledge of hereditary colorectal cancer, and to facilitate cancer research. Registry data
      will also be used to improve the quality of current standard of care through timely tracking
      and notification of patients for follow-up care, identification of registry participants at
      high risk for developing an inherited form of colon cancer, and by serving as a resource for
      future research.

      Registry patients may undergo optional blood, urine, and/or sputum sample collection for
      inclusion in the tissue repository. Tissue samples from a previous biopsy may also be
      obtained. Samples will be stored for future research studies.
